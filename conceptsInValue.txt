value of it as an escape house; higher but distance agnostic. 

Sources of personal value
* Kids learn to live in the woods
** Zero liabity freedom
** Difficulty of life without automation
** Not afraid of being away from people

* I have a retirement home (do I need one, or is the city nice enough?)
* I get to make a house; showing my kids how

* Escape location
** Kids need somewhere to crash
** Society turns against freedom
